# CS61A

**CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs** helps construct useful programming thinking in career.

A series of programming techniques are mentioned, such as data abstraction, object-oriented programming and functional programming.

I choose [course website (2020 fall)](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/) as the study material because its course material is complete enough.
